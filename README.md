This is the MRK1 Robot. It had a simple ESP32-Powered Webcam, the [M5 Unit Cam(MRK1)](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-cameras/products/unit-cam-wi-fi-camera-diy-kit-ov2640), and later a [M5 UnitV2(MRK2)](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-cameras/products/unitv2-ai-camera-gc2145) but both proved to be too laggy and useless. Unfortunately I did not take a picture of the Mrk 2 Robot before disassembling it because I built it at a really chaotic time in my life.
